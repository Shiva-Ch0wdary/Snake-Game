# Snake Game

A modern implementation of the classic Snake game using Java and Swing, complete with collision detection, scoring, and restart functionality.

## 🎮 Game Description

The **Snake Game** is a nostalgic arcade game where the player controls a snake to consume apples, growing longer with each apple eaten. The goal is to score as high as possible by eating apples while avoiding collisions with the boundaries of the game screen and the snake's own body.

### Features:
- **Smooth Controls**: Navigate the snake using arrow keys.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: The snake grows longer with every apple consumed.
- **Game Over Logic**: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the screen borders.
- **Restart Option**: Press `Enter` to restart the game after it ends.
- **Scoring System**: Your score is displayed at the top of the screen.
